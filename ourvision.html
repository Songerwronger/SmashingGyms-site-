        <h2 class="desc">Our future vision is an optimistic, aura of positivity, we hope to be seen as the leading brand when it comes to all things gym, to act as the hub when it comes to the gym, we cant newbies, experts, and everyone in between to be able to either find value is what were saying, or to realise the truth in it, and approve it for newer people, who are just getting into the gym.</h2>
        <h3 class="desc2">Our vision is that at one point, our site will be the “midpoint” for all gym enthusiasts, we want to eradicate the line between people, because when people believe that people more  experienced than them in the gym are better than them, then they create an instant division, we want to eradicate that, and encourage regular communication between all corners of experience, so that it becomes a flow of consistent knowledge and meaningful conversations that everyone can find value within. </h3>
        <h4 class="desc3">We hope to eventually achieve this with the help of the constantly growing, welcoming and helpful gym community, as more and more join and get involved with the conversation, people will start to feel more welcome.</h4>
