        <h1 class="hed">Starting, returning, refining? Were sure we can help, programmes to propel any type of Gym goer!: </h1>
        <h2 class="beg">Beginner</h2>
        <h1 class="begdesc">As a beginner, you don’t have anything to worry about when it comes to the possibility of reaching your goal, if you want to lose weight, gain muscle mass, as long as you go to the gym and lift weights/cardio, you will achieve your goal, simply because you’re doing more than you ever have in the past.</h1>
            <ul class="beglist">
                <li class="list1">2-3 days/week</li>
                <li class="list2">Each gym day corresponds to a different muscle group</li>
                <li class="list3">Choose exercises that best match you for each muscle group</li>
                <li class="list4">Make sure your form is correct (goes for all)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="inter">Intermediate</h3>
        <h1 class="intdesc">As an Intermediate in the gym, you probably already know what your goal is, and now its about finding the best and most optimal way to get to that goal, maybe your usual split is becoming stale and you’re not managing to progressively overload on you’re exercise anymore, sometimes to fix these issues, it’s the simple solutions we dismiss, such as: </h1>
            <ul class="intlist">
                <li class="1">4-5 days/week</li>
                <li class="2">Switch up exercises for new ones when they start to feel stale and unprogressive</li>
                <li class="3">Don’t work through an Injury, let them heal, and perfect form to ensure you don’t get injured</li>
            </ul>
        <h4 class="exp">Experienced</h4>
        <h1 class="expdesc">For all you tanks with boulder shoulders, who have been in the gym for years, I think you usually already know what you need to go when you have a goal in mind, but again, all the recommendations for each level do apply to all of them, sometimes the solution to an issue can be as simple as a different sitting position, a different form type, an adjustment in your lifting belt, its important to always revert back to basics when things seem impossible and just make sure you’re following basic principle </h1>
            <ul class="explist">
                <li class="1">Track lifts, how you felt whilst lifting, helps to regulate injury</li>
                <li class="2">Take rest days when you know you need to, at this level of experience, you know when your body needs a rest </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="horizline4"></div>
        <div class="overlay"></div>
    </div>


    <div class="bottomcont">
        <h1 class="bottitle">Remember that the most important thing is actually STARTING:</h1>
        <h2 class="botdesc">I think people tend to overcomplicate things, when it comes to gym, as you seasoned folk will know, the most crucial thing before starting to worry about types of exercises to do, if or not to buy creatine, what type of Protein powder to get, is to just get in the gym, start, get a feel for your body and how you are in that space.</h2>
        <h3 class="botdesc2">Its always better to ensure you’re comfortable doing exercises and certain movements before planning a full, rotational week long workout plan, that’s why we haven’t specifically given any workout plans, because here at SmashingGyms, we want to ensure all gym goers are fully prepped with the basics and knowledge so you can then go off and scour for a plan or make your own that fully suits your needs, goals and body.</h3>
