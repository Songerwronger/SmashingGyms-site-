# SmashingGyms-site-Code
This is a website (now complete) for a fictional company called SmashingGyms, this is a project i wanted to start to test my informational HTML/CSS creativity, whilst also completing some university webdev work.
This site does not have any backend built with is, as it was only needed to show my visual and front-end abilities.
